## *Example*

The following example describes one of the standard methods for publishing local contributions to the central repository. First, it makes sure your local master is up-to-date by fetching the central repositoryâ€™s copy and rebasing your changes on top of them. The interactive rebase is also a good opportunity to clean up your commits before sharing them. Then, the git push command sends all of the commits on your local master to the central repository.

>git checkout master
>
>git fetch origin master
>
>git rebase -i origin/master
>
>git push origin master
