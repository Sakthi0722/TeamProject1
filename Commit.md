# Commit

A git commit records changes to a repository.

A git commit is executed in the course of a project to record progress. This progress is then pushed to a remote repository (like on github.com) by executing a git push. These changes or progress could mean any additions, deletions, or updates to the files stored in the repository.

The quickest way to write a git commit is to use the command git commit -m "Git commit message here".

Commit messages are important, especially since Git tracks your changes and then displays them as commits once they're pushed to the server. By writing clear commit messages, you can make it easier for other people to follow along and provide feedback.
