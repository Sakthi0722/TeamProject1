# *WHY AUTOMATED TESTING?*

### *Reason 1: Automated Testing Saves Time and Money*
*Software tests have to be repeated often during development cycles to ensure quality. Every time source code is modified software tests should be repeated. For each release of the software it may be tested on all supported operating systems and hardware configurations. Manually repeating these tests is costly and time consuming. Once created, automated tests can be run over and over again at no additional cost and they are much faster than manual tests. Automated software testing can reduce the time to run repetitive tests from days to hours. A time savings that translates directly into cost savings.*

### *Reason 2: Vastly Increases Your Test Coverage*
*Automated software testing can increase the depth and scope of tests to help improve software quality. Lengthy tests that are often avoided during manual testing can be run unattended. They can even be run on multiple computers with different configurations. Automated software testing can look inside an application and see memory contents, data tables, file contents, and internal program states to determine if the product is behaving as expected. Test automation can easily execute thousands of different complex test cases during every test run providing coverage that is impossible with manual tests.*

### *Reason 3: Testing Improves Accuracy*
*Even the most conscientious tester will make mistakes during monotonous manual testing. Automated tests perform the same steps precisely every time they are executed and never forget to record detailed results. Testers freed from repetitive manual tests have more time to create new automated software tests and deal with complex features.*

### *Reason 4: Automation Does What Manual Testing Cannot*
*Even the largest software and QA departments cannot perform a controlled web application test with thousands of users. Automated testing can simulate tens, hundreds or thousands of virtual users interacting with a network, software and web applications.*

### *Reason 5: Automated Testing Helps Developers and Testers*
*Shared automated tests can be used by developers to catch problems quickly before sending to QA. Tests can run automatically whenever source code changes are checked in and notify the team or the developer if they fail. Features like these save developers time and increase their confidence.*

### *Reason 6: QA and Dev Team Morale Improves*
*This is hard to measure but weâ€™ve experienced it first-hand. Executing repetitive tasks with automated software testing gives your team time to spend on more challenging and rewarding projects. Team members improve their skill sets and confidence and, in turn, pass those gains on to their organization.*

### *Reason 7: Quickly Determine the Stability of Your Build*
*Test automation helps in automating tests to determine the stability of build. Often, smoke testing is used to validate stability. However, smoke testing is slow and requires manual input from the testing engineer such as setting up databases with test data.*

### *Reason 8: Eliminate Human Error*
*Unlike automated testing, manual testing opens up the opportunity for humans to make mistakes. Especially for complex scenarios, it makes sense to use test automation to avoid mistakes. One can still make mistakes, even with test automation. However, the rate of mistakes is significantly lower when using test automation.*
