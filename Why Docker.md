# Why Docker?
1. Docker is a tool that is designed to benefit both developers and system administrators, making it a part of many DevOps (developers + operations) toolchains.

2. For developers, it means that they can focus on writing code without worrying about the system that it will ultimately be running on.

3. It also allows them to get a head start by using one of thousands of programs already designed to run in a Docker container as a part of their application.

4. For operations staff, Docker gives flexibility and potentially reduces the number of systems needed because of its small footprint and lower overhead.

Three Reasons to use Docker:
1. **Fast, consistent delivery of your applications**

2. **Responsive deployment and scaling**

3. **Running more workloads on the same hardware**
