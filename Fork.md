# Fork
Whenever possible, it’s recommended to work in a common Git repository and use branching strategies to manage your work. However, if you do not have Writing access for the repository you want to contribute to, you can create a fork.

A fork is a personal copy of the repository and all its branches, which you create in a namespace of your choice. This way you can make changes in your own fork and submit them through a merge request to the repo you don’t have access to.

## Creating a fork
1. On the project’s home page, in the top right, click the Fork button.

 **Clone your fork**: You’ve successfully forked the Spoon-Knife repository, but so far, it only exists on GitHub. To be able to work on the project, you will need to clone it to your computer.
