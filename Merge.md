## Merge

One of Git's most powerful features is the ability to easily create and merge branches. Git distributed nature encourages users to create new branches often and to merge them regularly as a part of the development process. This fundamentally improves the development workflow for most projects by encouraging smaller, more focused, granular commits.

A commonly used branching workflow in Git is to create a new code branch for each new feature, bug fix, or enhancement. These are called Feature Branches. Each branch compartmentalizes the commits related to a particular feature. Once the new feature is complete – i.e. a set of changes has been committed on the feature branch – it is ready to be merged back into the master branch (or other main code line branch depending on the workflow in use).

## How to Merge

1. Fork a repository on GitHub(If not a Collaborator)

2. Clone it onto your computer

5. Checkout to Master branch

6. Git Merge the new branch with master
